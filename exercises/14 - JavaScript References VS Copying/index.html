    // console.log(age, age2);


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team is only a reference to the original array ("players")
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // returns the original array "players" 
    // if you don't pass anything into slice it returns a copy of the original array

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    //cannot do this
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // you start with a blank object, then pass in the object you want to copy the properties from, then fold in properties we want to over write
    Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
